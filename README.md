# Cafeteria_management_project_in_C++
Introduction<br>
The Cafeteria Management System is a C++ program designed to simulate the operations of a cafeteria, allowing customers to order items based on the time of day. The system categorizes menu items into breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner, each managed by a corresponding class. The program leverages various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more to achieve modularity, code reuse, and simplicity in managing complex operations.
<br>
<br>
Encapsulation<br>
Encapsulation is demonstrated in this project through the use of classes to bundle data (menu items) and methods (functions to manipulate this data). For example, the BreakFast, Lunch, Snacks, and Dinner classes encapsulate their respective menu items and provide methods to interact with these items (e.g., displaying the menu, updating quantities). By restricting direct access to these data members and requiring interaction through methods, the program maintains control over how the data is manipulated, ensuring integrity and security.
<br>
<br>
Inheritance<br>
Inheritance is used in the program to promote code reuse and establish a relationship
between classes. The Flage class is a base class that provides a welcome message method,
which is inherited by BreakFast, Lunch, Snacks, and Dinner classes. This allows all
these derived classes to share the same welcome functionality without duplicating code.
<br>
<br>
Polymorphism<br>
While the current implementation does not explicitly showcase polymorphism through virtual functions or method overriding, the structure is conducive to future polymorphic behavior. If the base class Flage had virtual methods called flage(), the derived classes could override these methods to provide specific implementations.
<br>
<br>
Abstraction<br>
Abstraction is achieved by using classes to represent complex entities such as menu items and their operations. The user interacts with high-level methods provided by these classes without needing to understand the underlying implementation details. This simplifies user interaction and focuses on what the object does rather than how it does it.
<br>
<br>
Friend Functions<br> 
The use of friend functions allows functions outside a class to access the private and protected members of the class. In this project, friend functions are used to facilitate operations that need to interact closely with class internals, such as processing orders in the function named checkBreakfast().
<br>
<br>
 
Use of Structs 	<br>
The program uses struct to define a simple data structure MenuItem for holding item details. This choice simplifies the code for representing plain data objects.
<br>		
 <br>
Standard Template Library (STL) - Vectors <br>
The use of vectors (dynamic array) from the Standard Template Library (STL) allows dynamic management of menu items. Vectors provide flexibility in handling collections of items, supporting dynamic resizing and providing various utility functions.

<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
The Cafeteria Management System leverages various OOP principles to create a modular,
reusable, and maintainable codebase. By using encapsulation, inheritance, and other OOP
features, the program efficiently manages the cafeteria's menu items and operations. These
principles not only help in organizing the code better but also enhance its scalability and
readability, making it easier to extend and maintain in the future.
